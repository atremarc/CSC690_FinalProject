Group Members:

Development Log:
4/11/18: Project Started, README.md created

Proposal:
My proposal is for a journaling app that has a procedurually generated prompt feature where the user can get the app to ask them a question which can serve as a topic to write on if they do not have a topic in mind. 

Features:
- Storage and revisting of past entries
- Procedurally generated promp/question feature
- Notification system to help user remember to make an entry each day
- ...
- TODO: more features?
   - search past entries for keyword feature
   - stats on user (how many entries per week on avg, word count avg, word length avg, sentence length avg...)
   - spell check (need to find good API for this)
