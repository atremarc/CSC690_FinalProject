Development Log:

4/18/19: Updated feature list

Proposal:
My proposal is for a journaling app that has a procedurually generated prompt feature where the user can get the app to ask them a question which can serve as a topic to write on if they do not have a topic in mind. 

Features:
- Storage and revisting of past entries
- Procedurally generated promp/question feature
- Notification system to help user remember to make an entry each day (not implemented)
- tracking: how many entries per week on average, word count average, favorite words (not implemented)
